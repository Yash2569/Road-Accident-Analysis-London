🧹 Data Cleaning (Power Query – Power BI)

The original dataset was preprocessed inside Power BI using Power Query Editor. Cleaning steps included:

- Replacing "fetal" with "fatal" in the Accident Severity column.
- Correcting "Auto traffic sigl" to "Auto traffic signal" in the Junction Control column.

> ⚠️ Cleaned data is not separately available; changes are reflected within the `.pbix` file.


🛠 Tools Used

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
